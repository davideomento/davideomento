# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm currently studying **Mathematical Engineering** with a **double degree in Data Science**.  
My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in **mathematics**, **statistics**, and **computer science**, which Iâ€™m eager to apply to real-world challenges.

I'm particularly passionate about **sports analytics** â€” a field where I can combine my technical skills with my lifelong love for sports, both as a **practitioner** and an **enthusiast**.  
Whether it's **performance analysis**, **strategy optimization**, or **data-driven decision making**, Iâ€™m excited about leveraging data to enhance the world of sports.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch!
